# Project-Management

This repository should be used for all coordination and project management issues that can not or should not discussed elsewhere. This includes preparation and wrap ups for team meetings, idea discussions, strategic discussions and input regarding communication.

The goal is to have a more organized approach and a central point to follow discussions without cluttering the other repositories.

There are two kinds of labels:

Workflow Labels:

* Assigned
* In Progress
* Feedback Needed
* External Help Needed
* Review Before Close
* Project and Idea Discussions
* Closed

These labels should be used to indicate the current status of the issue. If you change the label for non-obvious reason, please also submit a quick comment as to why you have changed it. For example, if you put it to "Feedback Needed" consider re-assigning it to the person you need feedback from or @-mentioning that person in a comment.

Also, always assign your issues, as soon as you take ownership or want someone else to take ownership. The only un-assigned issues should be project or idea discussions.

Topic Labels:

* Board Meetings
* Team Meetings
* Communication
* Community Blog
* Press Releases
* Show Cases
* WWX 2015 Follow Up
* etc.

These should be used to group issues by topic so that they can be filtered if needed. We might consider adding to these labels when a project discussion fragments into actionable tasks that can not be dealt with in other repositories.

The workflow labels tie in with the waffle.io board I have set up for a more visual approach to these issues:

You can drag the issues, update them, assign them, comment and so on just as you would on GitHub. You will also be able to see who is working on what and what is still left to be done.

Thank you!
